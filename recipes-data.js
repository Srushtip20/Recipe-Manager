    category: "North Indian",
    ingredients: [
        "1 cup regular rice (or idli rava)",
        "3/4 cup chana dal (or 1/4 cup urad + 1/2 cup chana dal for variation)",
        "1/2 cup thick sour yogurt (curd) or 1/2 cup water + 2 tbsp lemon (if not using curd)",

        "1 tbsp salt (adjust to taste)",
        "1/2 tsp sugar (optional, helps fermentation)",
        "1/2 tsp baking soda or 1 tsp ENO (add just before steaming)",
        "3–4 tbsp oil (for batter/tempering)",

        " Turn ON gas for a pan of boiling water (you'll use a steamer). Use medium-high flame so the water comes to a steady boil while you finish the batter. (If using an instant steamer/pressure cooker, you want steady steam.)",
        " Grind the soaked rice–dal mixture to a medium-thick, slightly coarse batter — add very little water only as needed. The batter should be thicker than idli batter but pourable. Transfer to a large bowl.",
        " Add 1/2 cup thick sour yogurt (or alternate liquid + lemon), 1 tsp turmeric, 1 tbsp salt, and 1/2 tsp sugar (optional). Mix well to a uniform batter.",
        " Cover the bowl with a lid or cloth. Keep in a warm place to ferment for 6–8 hours (or overnight) until the batter becomes slightly bubbly and mildly sour. (If your kitchen is cold, place inside the oven with the oven light on or near a warm appliance.)",
        " When batter is fermented and ready, gently stir it. If batter is too stiff, adjust consistency with a little water — it should spread level in the tray but not be runny.",
        " Grease a 8x8 or similar steaming tray with 1 tsp oil. Preheat steamer: If you turned ON gas earlier, ensure the water is boiling with steady steam (medium-high). If using a pressure cooker without whistle, keep some water and an inverted ring/stand inside.",

        " Pour the batter immediately into the greased steaming tray and smooth the top with a spoon.",
        " Place tray in the steamer. Close the lid. Steam on medium flame for 12–18 minutes (depending on thickness). CHECK at 12 minutes by inserting a toothpick — it should come out clean. If not, steam 2–3 minutes more.",
        " While dhokla steams, prepare tempering (vaghar). In a small pan, Turn ON gas to medium flame. Add 2 tbsp oil. Once hot, add 1 tsp mustard seeds. When they splutter, add 1/2 tsp cumin (optional), a pinch of hing, slit green chilies, and 8–10 curry leaves. Stir for 10–15 seconds and immediately add 2 tbsp water (careful — it may sputter). Turn OFF gas.",
        " When dhokla is done, Turn OFF gas on the steamer and carefully remove the tray. Let it sit 1–2 minutes. Spread the prepared tempering evenly over the steamed dhokla so it soaks in. Do this while dhokla is hot so flavors infuse.",
        " Cool 3–4 minutes, then cut into squares or diamond shapes. Garnish with chopped coriander and grated coconut (if using).",
        " Serve warm with green chutney and lemon wedges. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator for 1–2 days; reheat by steaming for 2–3 minutes."
